        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-Casinos-Could-Lose-2-Billion-in-Gambling-Stake"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Casinos-Could-Lose-2-Billion-in-Gambling-Stake" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Casinos Could Lose $2 Billion in Gambling Stake"></a>Atlantic City Casinos Could Lose $2 Billion in Gambling Stake</h1><p>Atlantic City’s casinos could lose as much as $2 billion in gambling stake over the next 10 years, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The analysis, released Tuesday by the consulting firm Econsult Solutions, projects that Pennsylvania’s aggressive expansion of casino gambling will siphon away business from Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The study estimates that Pennsylvania will see an increase of 14.8 million visitors by 2020, while Atlantic City will see a decrease of 9.5 million visitors. That will lead to total losses of $1.9 billion for Atlantic City casinos and $266 million for the state’s horse racing industry.</p>
<p>“Atlantic City is in trouble,” the report states bluntly. “It is facing significant and accelerating competition from surrounding states.”</p>
<p>Econsult Solutions is not the only one with such concerns. In November, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement issued a report that projected Atlantic City’s casino revenue would drop from $3.3 billion this year to $2.4 billion by 2018. The same report predicted that Pennsylvania’s casino industry would grow from $1.4 billion this year to $3.5 billion by 2018, becoming the second-largest market in the country behind Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said he wasn’t surprised by the findings in the Econsult Solutions report and said his administration has been planning for such an event for some time.</p>
<p>“We knew that our monopoly on casinos was going to end at some point,” Guardian said Tuesday night during his monthly radio call-in show on WGBB 1240 AM. “We have been diversifying our economy for the last four years so that we’re not so reliant on casinos.”</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-that-Gambling-Stake-Has-Little-to-Do-with-Luck"><a href="#Study-Shows-that-Gambling-Stake-Has-Little-to-Do-with-Luck" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows that Gambling Stake Has Little to Do with Luck"></a>Study Shows that Gambling Stake Has Little to Do with Luck</h1><p>A new study has shown that gambling stake has little to do with luck. The research, which was conducted by a team of scientists at the University of Oxford, found that people who bet higher amounts were no more likely to win than those who wagered smaller sums.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal “Nature Human Behaviour”, looked at data from nearly 7,000 online gamblers. Participants were asked to report how much they had won or lost on three different gambling games: blackjack, roulette and slots.</p>
<p>The researchers found that there was no clear relationship between stake and success. People who bet more money were no more likely to win than those who bet less. In fact, the study showed that people who won the most money only tended to do so by a small margin.</p>
<p>“Our results suggest that luck is not a major factor in determining gambling outcomes,” said Dr. Neil Stewart, one of the authors of the study. “Instead, it’s largely down to chance.”</p>
<p>The findings are contrary to popular belief, which holds that bigger stakes lead to bigger wins. In fact, the study suggests that there is no correlation between stake and success whatsoever.</p>
<p>So why do people continue to believe that betting big leads to big payouts? One possible explanation is that people tend to remember their successes more than their failures. When someone wins big at a casino, they are likely to tell their friends about it. But when they lose money, they are less likely to talk about it. This could lead to a distorted perception of how successful gambling actually is.</p>
<p>The findings of this study could have important implications for both casinos and gamblers alike. For casinos, it provides evidence that higher stakes do not necessarily mean larger profits. For gamblers, it suggests that taking bigger risks is not necessarily the best strategy for winning money.</p>
<h1 id="Australians-Gamble-Big-on-Gambling-Stake-in-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Australians-Gamble-Big-on-Gambling-Stake-in-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Australians Gamble Big on Gambling Stake in Online Casinos"></a>Australians Gamble Big on Gambling Stake in Online Casinos</h1><p>Australians, as a whole, have always had a love affair with gambling. This is evidenced by the fact that there are more than 200 casinos in the country, with over 90% of them being located in just a few states. In addition, Aussies wagered more than $24 billion on various gambling activities in 2016 alone.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that this penchant for gambling is transferring to online casinos. According to research from Morgan Stanley, Australians account for nearly 10% of the global online casino market, making them the second-largest contributors after the British. And this figure is only expected to grow in the coming years.</p>
<p>So why are Australians so keen on gambling at online casinos? There are likely several reasons for this trend. Firstly, there is the convenience factor – Australians can access online casinos from anywhere in the country, making it a convenient option for those who want to gamble.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the perception that online casinos are safer than traditional brick-and-mortar venues. This may be due to the fact that online casinos are regulated by various government agencies, whereas traditional casinos are not. Finally, there is also the perception that online casinos offer better odds and bigger jackpots than traditional venues.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that Australian gamblers are increasingly turning to online casinos as their preferred gambling venue. This is good news for operators such as Crown Resorts and Echo Entertainment Group, both of which have seen their share prices soar in recent years thanks to strong Australian performances at their respective online casinos businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Casino-removes-Gambling-Stake-from-Roulette-Tables"><a href="#Maryland-Casino-removes-Gambling-Stake-from-Roulette-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Casino removes Gambling Stake from Roulette Tables"></a>Maryland Casino removes Gambling Stake from Roulette Tables</h1><p>The Maryland Live Casino announced on Monday that it will remove the gambling stake from all of its roulette tables in order to comply with a new state law. The change went into effect at the casino on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The casino is one of six in the state that will have to make the change. Under the new law, which takes effect on October 1, casinos are no longer allowed to have a gambling stake in their roulette games.</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for our guests,” said Maryland Live general manager Rob Norton in a statement. “Removing the betting stake is one way we can do that.”</p>
<p>The move comes as the state looks to regulate its casinos more tightly. Earlier this year, the state legislature passed a bill that requires casinos to pay taxes on their revenues and limits how much they can pay out in jackpots.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say it will help ensure that Maryland’s casinos are regulated fairly and that taxpayers receive their fair share of revenue from the industry. Detractors argue that the regulations will make it harder for casinos to compete with neighboring states.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-Moves-to-Ban-Online-Gambling-After-Huge-Gambling-Stake-Losses"><a href="#Philippines-Moves-to-Ban-Online-Gambling-After-Huge-Gambling-Stake-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Moves to Ban Online Gambling After Huge Gambling Stake Losses"></a>Philippines Moves to Ban Online Gambling After Huge Gambling Stake Losses</h1><p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), the government-owned and controlled corporation tasked to regulate all forms of gambling in the Philippines, has announced a ban on online gambling.</p>
<p>The decision comes after PAGCOR revealed that it had lost almost 2.3 billion pesos (US$41.9 million) in its fight against illegal online gambling in the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>PAGCOR’s chairman Andrea Domingo said: “We have decided to ban all forms of online gambling. This is to protect our licensees, the public and our workforce”.</p>
<p>The ban will take effect from 1 September and will cover all types of online gambling, including casino games, sports betting and poker.</p>
<p> gaming companies operating in the Philippines are likely to be adversely affected by the ban. Bloomberry Resorts Corp, which operates Solaire Resort &amp; Casino in Manila, said that online gambling accounted for around 5% of its total revenues last year. Crown Resorts Ltd., which operates City of Dreams Manila, said that online gambling accounted for around 10% of its total revenues last year.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Philippines has attempted to ban online gambling. In February 2017, then-President Benigno Aquino III signed an executive order banning all forms of online gambling. However, this executive order was never implemented as it was overturned by a court ruling in May 2017.</p>
