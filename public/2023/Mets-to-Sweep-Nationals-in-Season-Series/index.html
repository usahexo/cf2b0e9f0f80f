        <h1 id="Mets-to-Sweep-Nationals-in-Season-Series"><a href="#Mets-to-Sweep-Nationals-in-Season-Series" class="headerlink" title="Mets to Sweep Nationals in Season Series"></a>Mets to Sweep Nationals in Season Series</h1><p>The Mets will look to sweep the Nationals in their season series when they take the field on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>New York took two of three games from Washington earlier this season, and they have won six of the last seven matchups between the two clubs.</p>
<p>The Nationals will send right-hander Tanner Roark to the mound on Sunday, while the Mets are expected to give the ball to Seth Lugo.</p>
<p>Washington has lost six of its last eight games overall and they are just 2-7 in their last nine contests on the road.</p>
<p>New York is coming off a disappointing loss on Saturday night, but they have still won six of their last nine games overall.</p>
<p>Lugo is 2-2 with a 4.85 ERA in eight starts this season, while Roark is 5-3 with a 3.46 ERA in 10 starts.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting matchup between two NL East rivals, and it could very well be decided by who has the advantage on the mound on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h1 id="Mets-Handicapping-Heavy-Favorites-Against-Nationals"><a href="#Mets-Handicapping-Heavy-Favorites-Against-Nationals" class="headerlink" title="Mets Handicapping: Heavy Favorites Against Nationals"></a>Mets Handicapping: Heavy Favorites Against Nationals</h1><p>The New York Mets are 8.5-point favorites against the Washington Nationals in today’s matchup, according to<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bodog.ca/"> Bodog </a>. This news may come as a surprise to some, as the Nationals have been one of the best teams in baseball this season. However, the Mets have been one of the hottest teams in baseball as well, and they currently hold the top spot in the National League East Division.</p>
<p>The Nationals will send Gio Gonzalez to the mound to face off against Mets’ starter Noah Syndergaard. Gonzalez has had a solid season for Washington, posting a 10-4 record with a 2.89 ERA. He has been especially good over his last eight starts, going 7-0 with a 1.03 ERA. Syndergaard has also had a great season for the Mets, posting an 8-2 record with a 3.06 ERA. He has been even better over his last six starts, going 5-0 with a 2.12 ERA.</p>
<p>Both of these pitchers have been outstanding this year and are worthy of consideration in fantasy baseball leagues. However, Gonzalez is probably the better pick today given his recent form and the fact that he is facing off against a weaker opponent. The Mets are likely to win this game, but Gonzalez should still be considered as a strong starting option in fantasy leagues today</p>
<h1 id="Mets-Could-Clinch-Playoff-Berth-with-Series-Victory-Over-Nationals"><a href="#Mets-Could-Clinch-Playoff-Berth-with-Series-Victory-Over-Nationals" class="headerlink" title="Mets Could Clinch Playoff Berth with Series Victory Over Nationals"></a>Mets Could Clinch Playoff Berth with Series Victory Over Nationals</h1><p>A series victory over the Nationals this week would clinch a playoff berth for the Mets, who have been one of the most inconsistent teams in baseball all season.</p>
<p>The Mets were barely hanging on to a Wild Card spot as recently as early September, but they have since won 9 of their last 10 games to pull ahead of the Cardinals and Brewers in the NL playoff race.</p>
<p>The Nationals, meanwhile, were cruising towards the top of the NL East until recently, when they lost 8 of their last 10 games to fall into a tie with the Braves for first place.</p>
<p>If the season ended today, the Mets would host the Nationals in a one-game playoff to decide who advances to the Divisional Round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>But if Washington can win this crucial series against their division rivals, they would solidify their spot at the top of the NL East and avoid having to play any more extra games.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-vs-New-York-Mets-Betting-Odds-and-Pick"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-vs-New-York-Mets-Betting-Odds-and-Pick" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals vs New York Mets Betting Odds and Pick"></a>Washington Nationals vs New York Mets Betting Odds and Pick</h1><p>The Washington Nationals are in first place in the NL East, but they will have their hands full when they visit the New York Mets this weekend. The Mets have won eight of their last 10 games to pull within four games of the Nats in the division.</p>
<p>Washington is favored to win this series, but New York has been playing well and should not be counted out. Let’s take a look at the odds for each game and pick a winner.</p>
<p>Friday, July 6th</p>
<p>Max Scherzer (10-5, 2.06 ERA) will start for the Nationals, while Jacob deGrom (5-7, 3.47 ERA) will get the ball for the Mets. Scherzer has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this season, while deGrom has struggled a bit but is still a solid starter.</p>
<p>Washington is a -185 favorite in this game, and I think that is about right. Scherzer is an elite pitcher and should be able to shut down the Mets’ lineup. New York does have some good hitters, but I think they will struggle against Scherzer’s fastball and slider.</p>
<p>The over&#x2F;under for this game is 8.5 runs, and I would take the over. Both pitchers have been strong this season and I expect them to both pitch well in this game. There should be plenty of offense from both teams, and I think it will be a close game that goes over 8.5 runs.</p>
<p>Saturday, July 7th</p>
<p> Tanner Roark (3-9, 4.85 ERA) will start for Washington, while Steven Matz (4-6, 3.46 ERA) will take the mound for New York. Roark has had a disappointing season so far, while Matz has been one of the Mets’ most consistent starters.</p>
<p>Washington is a -140 favorite in this game, and I like them to win again. Roark has not been very good this season, but he can usually be counted on to at least make it through five innings. The Nats’ lineup should be able to score enough runs to win against Matz.</p>
<p>The over&#x2F;under for Saturday’s game is 9 runs, and I like the over again here.. This matchup features two pitchers who have been trending in opposite directions recently – Roark has been struggling lately while Matz has been pitching very well – so I think we could see some fireworks in this game. There should be plenty of runs scored by both teams, so take the over 9 runs here!</p>
<p>Sunday, July 8th<br>1:10pm ET<br>Gio Gonzalez (7-4 , 2 .92 ERA) will start for Washington against Jason Vargas (2 -8 , 8 .36 ERA). Gonzalez has pitched very well this season and is coming off of a complete game victory against the Atlanta Braves last week . Vargas has struggled mightily since joining the Mets , so Washington should have no trouble winning this game . The Nationals are -220 favorites in this matchup , and I think they are worth betting on Sunday .</p>
<h1 id="Expert-Picks-Who-Wins-the-Mets-Nationals-Showdown"><a href="#Expert-Picks-Who-Wins-the-Mets-Nationals-Showdown" class="headerlink" title="Expert Picks: Who Wins the Mets-Nationals Showdown?"></a>Expert Picks: Who Wins the Mets-Nationals Showdown?</h1><p>The Nationals (27-15) head into their matchup against the Mets (21-22) on Monday with the best record in baseball. Washington has won six of its last seven games, while New York has lost four of its last six.</p>
<p>The Nationals have a deep and talented roster, but the Mets still have pitchers like Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard who can give them a chance to win any game. In the end, I think the Nationals are too strong and will win this series 3-1.</p>
<p>Bryce Harper has been on an absolute tear this year, and I think he will continue his hot streak against the Mets. Anthony Rendon is also playing well, and I expect him to have some big hits in this series.</p>
<p>In terms of the Mets, I think Michael Conforto will be their best bet to produce some offence. He has been slumping lately, but I think he will break out of it in this series. Jeurys Familia is also coming off a solid outing on Sunday and should be able to shut down the Nationals’ offence in late innings.</p>
