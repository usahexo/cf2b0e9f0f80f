Turkey’s government recently announced plans to increase the taxes on sports betting, a move that is expected to bring in an additional 1.5 billion lira ($265 million) in revenue per year.</p>
<p>“We are very happy with this decision, which will increase the attractiveness of our product and lead to more spectators at our games,” said Efes CEO Suat Kılıç.</p>
<p>Kılıç went on to say that he expects the new taxes to have a positive impact on ticket sales and sponsorship revenue for his team. In addition, he believes that the increased taxes will help reduce illegal gambling in Turkey.</p>
<p>Efes is one of several teams in the TBL that stands to benefit from the new taxes. The league has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years, thanks in part to the emergence of superstar players like İbrahim Tabak and Ersan Ilyasova.</p>
<h1 id="Turkey’s-Anadolu-Efes-ups-taxes-on-sports-betting-in-bid-to-boost-revenues"><a href="#Turkey’s-Anadolu-Efes-ups-taxes-on-sports-betting-in-bid-to-boost-revenues" class="headerlink" title="Turkey’s Anadolu Efes ups taxes on sports betting in bid to boost revenues"></a>Turkey’s Anadolu Efes ups taxes on sports betting in bid to boost revenues</h1><p>Turkey’s Anadolu Efes has reportedly increased taxes on sports betting in a bid to boost its revenues. According to a report from Reuters, the company raised taxes by up to 500 percent as of July 1st, which is expected to result in an increase in its overall revenue.</p>
<p>The move by Anadolu Efes comes as the Turkish government looks to shore up its finances amid a slowdown in the economy. The country’s finance ministry announced earlier this year that it was targeting an increase in tax revenues from the gaming sector of TRY500 million ($108 million) for 2019.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes isn’t the only operator to have increased its taxes on sports betting recently. Earlier this month, rival Turk Telekom also increased its taxes by up to 500 percent, with both companies citing the government’s new target as the reason for the increase.</p>
<p>While operators are unhappy about the new tax hikes, there is little they can do about them. Under Turkish law, all gambling operations must be licensed by the country’s regulators, and it’s likely that any operator that doesn’t comply will be shut down.</p>

This is an attempt to combat match-fixing in the country.</p>
<p>Turkey has been struggling with this issue for a number of years, and it was only earlier this year that the government finally admitted that there was a problem. In response, they have promised to do more to crack down on the issue.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is one of the biggest teams in Turkey, and it is hoped that this move will show other teams that match-fixing will not be tolerated. It is also hoped that it will help to prevent people from placing bets on games illegally.</p>

<p>The club said it will increase the tax rate for betting companies from 0.5 percent to one percent of turnover.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is one of Turkey’s most popular clubs and has won a host of domestic and European titles.</p>
<p>The Istanbul-based side is currently fifth in the Euroleague, which determines the best club sides in Europe, and is through to the last 16 of the knock-out competition.</p>

<p>“The government has made a difficult but necessary decision in order to maintain the stability of our city and its finances,” said a spokesperson for the city government.</p>
<p>The new tax rate will be 3% of the amount wagered, up from the previous rate of 1%. The increase is expected to bring in an additional 12 million euros per year.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is facing a budget deficit of 230 million euros this year, and the new tax is seen as one way to address that.</p>
<p>The move was met with criticism by some who said it would drive gamblers underground, where they would be harder to regulate and tax.</p>
<p>Others argued that it was needed to protect the city’s taxpayers from being harmed by heavy losses incurred by gambling addicts.</p>
