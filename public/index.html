        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-Casinos-Could-Lose-2-Billion-in-Gambling-Stake"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Casinos-Could-Lose-2-Billion-in-Gambling-Stake" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Casinos Could Lose $2 Billion in Gambling Stake"></a>Atlantic City Casinos Could Lose $2 Billion in Gambling Stake</h1><p>Atlantic City’s casinos could lose as much as $2 billion in gambling stake over the next 10 years, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The analysis, released Tuesday by the consulting firm Econsult Solutions, projects that Pennsylvania’s aggressive expansion of casino gambling will siphon away business from Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The study estimates that Pennsylvania will see an increase of 14.8 million visitors by 2020, while Atlantic City will see a decrease of 9.5 million visitors. That will lead to total losses of $1.9 billion for Atlantic City casinos and $266 million for the state’s horse racing industry.</p>
<p>“Atlantic City is in trouble,” the report states bluntly. “It is facing significant and accelerating competition from surrounding states.”</p>
<p>Econsult Solutions is not the only one with such concerns. In November, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement issued a report that projected Atlantic City’s casino revenue would drop from $3.3 billion this year to $2.4 billion by 2018. The same report predicted that Pennsylvania’s casino industry would grow from $1.4 billion this year to $3.5 billion by 2018, becoming the second-largest market in the country behind Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said he wasn’t surprised by the findings in the Econsult Solutions report and said his administration has been planning for such an event for some time.</p>
<p>“We knew that our monopoly on casinos was going to end at some point,” Guardian said Tuesday night during his monthly radio call-in show on WGBB 1240 AM. “We have been diversifying our economy for the last four years so that we’re not so reliant on casinos.”</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-that-Gambling-Stake-Has-Little-to-Do-with-Luck"><a href="#Study-Shows-that-Gambling-Stake-Has-Little-to-Do-with-Luck" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows that Gambling Stake Has Little to Do with Luck"></a>Study Shows that Gambling Stake Has Little to Do with Luck</h1><p>A new study has shown that gambling stake has little to do with luck. The research, which was conducted by a team of scientists at the University of Oxford, found that people who bet higher amounts were no more likely to win than those who wagered smaller sums.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal “Nature Human Behaviour”, looked at data from nearly 7,000 online gamblers. Participants were asked to report how much they had won or lost on three different gambling games: blackjack, roulette and slots.</p>
<p>The researchers found that there was no clear relationship between stake and success. People who bet more money were no more likely to win than those who bet less. In fact, the study showed that people who won the most money only tended to do so by a small margin.</p>
<p>“Our results suggest that luck is not a major factor in determining gambling outcomes,” said Dr. Neil Stewart, one of the authors of the study. “Instead, it’s largely down to chance.”</p>
<p>The findings are contrary to popular belief, which holds that bigger stakes lead to bigger wins. In fact, the study suggests that there is no correlation between stake and success whatsoever.</p>
<p>So why do people continue to believe that betting big leads to big payouts? One possible explanation is that people tend to remember their successes more than their failures. When someone wins big at a casino, they are likely to tell their friends about it. But when they lose money, they are less likely to talk about it. This could lead to a distorted perception of how successful gambling actually is.</p>
<p>The findings of this study could have important implications for both casinos and gamblers alike. For casinos, it provides evidence that higher stakes do not necessarily mean larger profits. For gamblers, it suggests that taking bigger risks is not necessarily the best strategy for winning money.</p>
<h1 id="Australians-Gamble-Big-on-Gambling-Stake-in-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Australians-Gamble-Big-on-Gambling-Stake-in-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Australians Gamble Big on Gambling Stake in Online Casinos"></a>Australians Gamble Big on Gambling Stake in Online Casinos</h1><p>Australians, as a whole, have always had a love affair with gambling. This is evidenced by the fact that there are more than 200 casinos in the country, with over 90% of them being located in just a few states. In addition, Aussies wagered more than $24 billion on various gambling activities in 2016 alone.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that this penchant for gambling is transferring to online casinos. According to research from Morgan Stanley, Australians account for nearly 10% of the global online casino market, making them the second-largest contributors after the British. And this figure is only expected to grow in the coming years.</p>
<p>So why are Australians so keen on gambling at online casinos? There are likely several reasons for this trend. Firstly, there is the convenience factor – Australians can access online casinos from anywhere in the country, making it a convenient option for those who want to gamble.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the perception that online casinos are safer than traditional brick-and-mortar venues. This may be due to the fact that online casinos are regulated by various government agencies, whereas traditional casinos are not. Finally, there is also the perception that online casinos offer better odds and bigger jackpots than traditional venues.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that Australian gamblers are increasingly turning to online casinos as their preferred gambling venue. This is good news for operators such as Crown Resorts and Echo Entertainment Group, both of which have seen their share prices soar in recent years thanks to strong Australian performances at their respective online casinos businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Casino-removes-Gambling-Stake-from-Roulette-Tables"><a href="#Maryland-Casino-removes-Gambling-Stake-from-Roulette-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Casino removes Gambling Stake from Roulette Tables"></a>Maryland Casino removes Gambling Stake from Roulette Tables</h1><p>The Maryland Live Casino announced on Monday that it will remove the gambling stake from all of its roulette tables in order to comply with a new state law. The change went into effect at the casino on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The casino is one of six in the state that will have to make the change. Under the new law, which takes effect on October 1, casinos are no longer allowed to have a gambling stake in their roulette games.</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for our guests,” said Maryland Live general manager Rob Norton in a statement. “Removing the betting stake is one way we can do that.”</p>
<p>The move comes as the state looks to regulate its casinos more tightly. Earlier this year, the state legislature passed a bill that requires casinos to pay taxes on their revenues and limits how much they can pay out in jackpots.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say it will help ensure that Maryland’s casinos are regulated fairly and that taxpayers receive their fair share of revenue from the industry. Detractors argue that the regulations will make it harder for casinos to compete with neighboring states.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-Moves-to-Ban-Online-Gambling-After-Huge-Gambling-Stake-Losses"><a href="#Philippines-Moves-to-Ban-Online-Gambling-After-Huge-Gambling-Stake-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Moves to Ban Online Gambling After Huge Gambling Stake Losses"></a>Philippines Moves to Ban Online Gambling After Huge Gambling Stake Losses</h1><p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), the government-owned and controlled corporation tasked to regulate all forms of gambling in the Philippines, has announced a ban on online gambling.</p>
<p>The decision comes after PAGCOR revealed that it had lost almost 2.3 billion pesos (US$41.9 million) in its fight against illegal online gambling in the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>PAGCOR’s chairman Andrea Domingo said: “We have decided to ban all forms of online gambling. This is to protect our licensees, the public and our workforce”.</p>
<p>The ban will take effect from 1 September and will cover all types of online gambling, including casino games, sports betting and poker.</p>
<p> gaming companies operating in the Philippines are likely to be adversely affected by the ban. Bloomberry Resorts Corp, which operates Solaire Resort &amp; Casino in Manila, said that online gambling accounted for around 5% of its total revenues last year. Crown Resorts Ltd., which operates City of Dreams Manila, said that online gambling accounted for around 10% of its total revenues last year.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Philippines has attempted to ban online gambling. In February 2017, then-President Benigno Aquino III signed an executive order banning all forms of online gambling. However, this executive order was never implemented as it was overturned by a court ruling in May 2017.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal recently reported that casino companies such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment could see their operations in the US come to a grinding halt in the near future. That’s because more states are moving to prohibit online gambling, which is seen as a major threat to the industry.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are 10 states that allow some form of online gambling. But this could soon change, with lawmakers in several states – including New York, Illinois and Michigan – pushing for bans on the activity.</p>
<p>This isn’t good news for casino operators, many of whom have seen their profits dwindle in recent years. In 2017, American casino revenue fell by 5%, according to industry research firm GPI. Much of this can be attributed to the growth of online gambling, which has eaten into the profits of casinos operating in traditional formats.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether lawmakers will be successful in their efforts to ban online gambling. But if they are, it could have a devastating impact on the US casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="Make-Sure-Your-Cables-Are-United-Before-Visiting-Any-US-Casino"><a href="#Make-Sure-Your-Cables-Are-United-Before-Visiting-Any-US-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Make Sure Your Cables Are United Before Visiting Any US Casino"></a>Make Sure Your Cables Are United Before Visiting Any US Casino</h1><p>As one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, the United States is home to dozens of casino resorts. From the massive Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to the intimate Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, these properties offer something for everyone.</p>
<p>No matter which casino you choose to visit, though, one thing is always important: make sure your cables are united. By that, we mean make sure all your cables - phone, power, and data - are plugged into the same outlet before entering the property.</p>
<p>If you’re not careful, you could find yourself without power or data access when you need it most. And in this age of smartphones and mobile gaming, that’s a mistake you can’t afford to make.</p>
<p>So before hitting the road for your next casino vacation, be sure to check out our guide to cable management and make sure everything is plugged in properly. And remember: united we stand, divided we fall!</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <h1 id="NJ-Casinos-Raise-Minimum-Age-To-Purchase-Hotel-Rooms"><a href="#NJ-Casinos-Raise-Minimum-Age-To-Purchase-Hotel-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="NJ Casinos Raise Minimum Age To Purchase Hotel Rooms"></a>NJ Casinos Raise Minimum Age To Purchase Hotel Rooms</h1><h2 id="Minimum-age-for-hotel-rooms-at-NJ-casinos-raised-to-21"><a href="#Minimum-age-for-hotel-rooms-at-NJ-casinos-raised-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum age for hotel rooms at NJ casinos raised to 21"></a>Minimum age for hotel rooms at NJ casinos raised to 21</h2><p>On Tuesday, the New Jersey state Casino Control Commission voted unanimously to raise the minimum age for Hotel rooms from 18 to 21 years old. Casinos feel that this will help stop underage gambling and also shield casino floors from being viewed as youth party destinations. </p>
<p>The decision comes as the latest effort by casinos to combat what they see as a growing problem of underage gambling in the Garden State. Commissioner Joseph J. Orlando Jr. said that “By raising the minimum age for hotel rooms, we are putting in place another barrier to protect our young people and deter them from engaging in illegal activity on our casino properties.” </p>
<p>Commissioner James Plousis added that this would make it more difficult for minors to get into the casino floor and gamble. Plousis also cited concerns over social media platforms, such as Facebook and Snapchat, which have made it easier for minors to gamble illegally. </p>
<p>There was some pushback on the measure, with some arguing that it would just push underage gamblers off-property and into other venues where there is no regulation or oversight.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-Age-For-Hotel-Room-Reservations-Increased"><a href="#Minimum-Age-For-Hotel-Room-Reservations-Increased" class="headerlink" title="Minimum Age For Hotel Room Reservations Increased"></a>Minimum Age For Hotel Room Reservations Increased</h1><p>This morning, it was announced that the minimum age for hotel room reservations will be increased from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>The news was met with mixed reactions. While some people argue that the change is necessary in order to ensure the safety of guests, others believe that it will unfairly impact families who are traveling with children.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the hotel industry trade group AH&amp;LA, the new policy is aimed at preventing underage guests from accessing alcohol and drugs in hotel rooms.</p>
<p>“Safety is always our top priority and we believe raising the minimum age will help reduce dangerous activities in our rooms,” said AH&amp;LA president and CEO Katherine Lugar.</p>
<p>The decision comes on the heels of several high-profile incidents involving young guests and drugs or alcohol. In March, an eight-year-old boy was found dead in a hotel pool after drinking vodka from a minibar. And last year, an intoxicated teenager allegedly killed a security guard at the Wynn Las Vegas Resort.</p>
<p>Some opponents of the policy argue that it unfairly targets young adults who are legally allowed to drink in other public settings. Kara Hnatko, spokesperson for the group Freedom 21, released a statement saying:</p>
<p>“Freedom 21 supports efforts to keep minors safe, but this misguided policy simply punishes responsible adults and does little to actually protect kids. It’s unfair to make it harder for families to travel and enjoy time together simply because an arbitrary age cutoff has been established.”</p>
<p>Others have voiced concerns about potential implications for college students who often book rooms near campus for parents visiting during school breaks.</p>
<p>Despite opposition, it appears that the updated policy is here to stay. In a statement released yesterday, AH&amp;LA said that they “look forward to working with our partners in government and across the travel industry to ensure a smooth transition to this new standard.”</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Casinos-Increase-Minimum-Age-To-Book-Hotel-Rooms"><a href="#NJ-Casinos-Increase-Minimum-Age-To-Book-Hotel-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="NJ Casinos Increase Minimum Age To Book Hotel Rooms"></a>NJ Casinos Increase Minimum Age To Book Hotel Rooms</h1><p>Minimum age has been increased at all casinos in New Jersey to 21 in order to book a hotel room. The new policy, which went into effect on January 1, 2019, applies to all casino resorts in Atlantic City and the Garden State.</p>
<p>The decision comes as part of an effort by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) to “strengthen anti-money laundering controls” at the state’s casinos.</p>
<p>“To protect the interests of casino patrons and comply with state regulations, the Division of Gaming Enforcement has implemented a minimum age of 21 years old to reserve a hotel room at a casino resort within New Jersey,” said DGE Director David Rebuck in a statement.</p>
<p>The minimum age for other activities such as table games or slot machines will remain 18.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-Age-For-Casino-Hotel-Reservations-Now-21"><a href="#Minimum-Age-For-Casino-Hotel-Reservations-Now-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum Age For Casino Hotel Reservations Now 21"></a>Minimum Age For Casino Hotel Reservations Now 21</h1><p>In response to the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada lawmakers have voted to raise the minimum age for casino hotel reservations from 18 to 21. The move is an effort to prevent future tragedies by keeping young people from accessing gambling and firearms in one place.</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation say that it will only push underage gamblers into illegal offshore casinos, but supporters argue that it will make it more difficult for those with mental health issues to obtain guns and commit mass shootings.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of gun control measures that have been enacted in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Just a few days ago, Congress passed a bill that would ban bump stocks, which were used by the gunman in Las Vegas to increase the firepower of his weapons.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is seen as a victory for gun control advocates, who have been pushing for stricter gun laws since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. However, many Republicans oppose these measures, arguing that they infringe on Americans’ Second Amendment rights.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Casinos-Increase-Minimum-Age-For-Purchasing-Hotel-Rooms"><a href="#NJ-Casinos-Increase-Minimum-Age-For-Purchasing-Hotel-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="NJ Casinos Increase Minimum Age For Purchasing Hotel Rooms"></a>NJ Casinos Increase Minimum Age For Purchasing Hotel Rooms</h1><p>In an effort to prevent members of the younger generation from gambling in the state’s casinos, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has voted to increase the minimum age for purchasing a hotel room at a casino property to 21 years old. The new rule will go into effect on January 1, 2018.</p>
<p>“This is an important step in our continued efforts to protect New Jersey’s casino industry and its players,” said Director David Rebuck. “The decision to increase the minimum age for purchasing a hotel room at a casino property to 21 years old will help further reduce the potential for underage gambling.”</p>
<p>Underage gambling is a problem that plagues not just the casino industry, but also other forms of gambling, such as horse racing and lotteries. In fact, it’s estimated that up to half of all problem gamblers are under the legal gambling age.</p>
<p>While some people may view this new rule as an inconvenience, supporters say that it’s necessary to help keep young people from developing a gambling addiction. And with casinos becoming increasingly popular among millennials, it’s important to take steps to prevent them from engaging in this type of behavior.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been any opposition to the new rule, and it’s expected to be met with little resistance from hotel operators. In fact, many of them have already begun raising their minimum ages for hotel rooms in anticipation of the change.</p>

        <h1 id="Martin-Scorsese-to-Direct-Casino"><a href="#Martin-Scorsese-to-Direct-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Martin Scorsese to Direct Casino"></a>Martin Scorsese to Direct Casino</h1><p>In a surprise move, Martin Scorsese has announced that he will be directing the next Casino movie. The film, which is already in pre-production, will star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.</p>
<p>This will be the third time that Scorsese and De Niro have worked together, after Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. It will also be the fourth time that Scorsese and Pesci have teamed up, after Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino.</p>
<p>Casino was released in 1995 and was based on a true story. It starred De Niro, Pesci, Sharon Stone, and James Woods. It was a massive hit at the box office and won two Academy Awards.</p>
<p>In August of last year, it was announced that Pesci was officially retiring from acting. This means that this will be his final role on the big screen.</p>
<p>No further details about the film have been released as of yet.</p>
<h1 id="Sam-Mendes-to-Direct-Casino"><a href="#Sam-Mendes-to-Direct-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Sam Mendes to Direct Casino"></a>Sam Mendes to Direct Casino</h1><p>Sam Mendes will be directing the next James Bond movie, Casino. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming.</p>
<p>The plot for the movie is still under wraps, but it is known that Mendes will be using some of the plot points from the original book. The movie is set to start filming in early 2020 and is set to be released in November of that year.</p>
<p>Casino will be Mendes’ second James Bond movie. He previously directed Skyfall which was released in 2012 and went on to become the highest-grossing Bond movie ever made.</p>
<p>Mendes is no stranger to success when it comes to movies. He has won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and two BAFTA Awards. His work on Skyfall earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Director.</p>
<p>Daniel Craig will once again be playing James Bond and is looking forward to working with Mendes again. “His films are emotional, stirring and he gets the best out of his actors,” Craig said about Mendes in an interview with Empire magazine. “I always enjoy working with him.”</p>
<h1 id="Martin-Scorsese-and-Sam-Mendes-to-Co-Direct-Casino"><a href="#Martin-Scorsese-and-Sam-Mendes-to-Co-Direct-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes to Co-Direct Casino"></a>Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes to Co-Direct Casino</h1><p>Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes are set to co-direct the upcoming Warner Bros. film Casino. The two Oscar-winning filmmakers will reunite after teaming up on the stage production of “Cabaret” in 2014.</p>
<p>The movie is based on the 1995 book by Nicholas Pileggi, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie version of “Goodfellas”, which was directed by Scorsese. Pileggi’s book tells the true story of mobster Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran and his involvement in the casino industry in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>No casting decisions have been announced yet, but it is expected that Leonardo DiCaprio will star in the lead role. DiCaprio previously worked with Scorsese on “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Gangs of New York”, and has expressed his interest in playing Sheeran in the past.</p>
<p>Mendes is no stranger to directing movies based on true stories either, having won an Oscar for his work on “American Beauty”. He last directed the James Bond film “Skyfall” in 2012.</p>
<p>Casino is expected to begin production in early 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Steven-Spielberg-to-Direct-Casino"><a href="#Steven-Spielberg-to-Direct-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Steven Spielberg to Direct Casino"></a>Steven Spielberg to Direct Casino</h1><p>Casino will be directed by Steven Spielberg and is set to release in theaters on November 22, 2019.</p>
<p>The film is based on the book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie.</p>
<p>Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are set to reprise their roles as Sam “Ace” Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, respectively. The rest of the cast has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>This will be the first time that De Niro and Pesci have starred in a movie together since 1995’s Casino.</p>
<h1 id="Quentin-Tarantino-to-Direct-Casino"><a href="#Quentin-Tarantino-to-Direct-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Quentin Tarantino to Direct Casino"></a>Quentin Tarantino to Direct Casino</h1><p>Casino, the movie about the rise and fall of mobsters in Las Vegas, is set to get a new lease on life, with Quentin Tarantino set to direct.</p>
<p>The project has been in development for years, but it looks like it’s finally going to happen, with The Hateful Eight filmmaker taking the reins.</p>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio is said to be eyeing a role in the movie, possibly as casino kingpin Frank Rosenthal.</p>
<p>Martin Scorsese was originally attached to direct Casino, but he eventually left the project. Now it looks like Tarantino is going to take up the challenge and bring his unique vision to the movie.</p>
<p>This could be an interesting pairing, with Tarantino’s style matched against Scorsese’s more traditional approach. It should be interesting to see how they both shape the story of Casino.</p>
<p>Casino is based on a true story, and follows the rise and fall of mobsters like Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel. It promises to be a thrilling movie full of action and suspense.</p>

<h1 id="Why-You-Should-Use-Insurance-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-WorldMatch"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Use-Insurance-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-WorldMatch" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Use Insurance in Blackjack at Casino WorldMatch"></a>Why You Should Use Insurance in Blackjack at Casino WorldMatch</h1><p>There are a few important reasons why insurance should be used in blackjack at Casino WorldMatch. The first reason is that insurance can help you protect your bankroll. By betting a small amount of your bankroll on insurance, you can reduce the amount of money you lose if the dealer has a blackjack.</p>
<p>Another reason to use insurance is that it can help you improve your chances of winning. When you have a blackjack, your odds of winning are increased significantly, and insurance can help you capitalize on these better odds.</p>
<p>Finally, insurance is a great way to make your blackjack games more exciting. By betting on insurance, you can add an extra level of excitement to your game and give yourself a chance to win some extra money.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Use-Insurance-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-WorldMatch"><a href="#How-to-Use-Insurance-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-WorldMatch" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Insurance in Blackjack at Casino WorldMatch"></a>How to Use Insurance in Blackjack at Casino WorldMatch</h1><p>Almost every casino game has an insurance bet, and blackjack is no exception. While the insurance bet itself is optional, it’s important to understand what it is and when you should make it. In this guide, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about using blackjack insurance at Casino WorldMatch.</p>
<p>What is Blackjack Insurance?</p>
<p>Insurance is a side bet that you can make in blackjack. When you make an insurance bet, you’re betting that the dealer has blackjack. If the dealer does have blackjack, your insurance bet pays out 2-1. However, if the dealer doesn’t have blackjack, your insurance bet loses.</p>
<p>When Should I Make an Insurance Bet?</p>
<p>There are a few things to consider before making an insurance bet. The most important factor is whether or not you think the dealer has blackjack. If you think the dealer has a strong hand, then you should probably avoid making an insurance bet. However, if you think the dealer is weak, then making an insurance bet could be a good idea.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is how much money you stand to win or lose if the dealer does have blackjack. If the potential payout is high enough, then making an insurance bet might be worth it even if the odds aren’t great. Conversely, if the potential payout is low, then it might not be worth it to make an insurance bet.</p>
<h1 id="Insurance-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-WorldMatch-How-It-Works"><a href="#Insurance-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-WorldMatch-How-It-Works" class="headerlink" title="Insurance in Blackjack at Casino WorldMatch: How It Works"></a>Insurance in Blackjack at Casino WorldMatch: How It Works</h1><p>If you gamble in a casino, there is a good chance that you will come across blackjack. The game is very popular for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it offers players the chance to win big payouts. However, like any casino game, there is always the risk of losing money. One way to reduce this risk is to insure your bet. In this article, we will explain how insurance works in blackjack and discuss whether or not it is a wise decision to purchase it.</p>
<p>When you are playing blackjack at Casino WorldMatch, you have the option of buying insurance for your bet. This is a side bet that you can make in addition to your original wager. If the dealer has an ace showing, you can choose to buy insurance. If the dealer then hits and gets Blackjack (a 21), your insurance payouts will be 2:1 on your original bet amount. So if you placed a $10 bet and purchased insurance, you would get paid $20 if the dealer gets Blackjack.</p>
<p>While it may seem like an attractive proposition to buy insurance when you are playing blackjack, there are some things to consider before doing so. First of all, the odds of the dealer getting Blackjack are relatively low – around 1 in 4. So even if you do purchase insurance, your chances of winning are only about 25%. Additionally, Insurance generally costs twice as much as the amount you stand to win if it pays off, so it is not advisable to buy it unless the potential payout is really high.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while buying insurance may seem like a good idea when playing blackjack at Casino WorldMatch, it is usually not worth doing so because the odds are against you. However, if the potential payout is large enough, purchasing insurance can be a wise decision.</p>
