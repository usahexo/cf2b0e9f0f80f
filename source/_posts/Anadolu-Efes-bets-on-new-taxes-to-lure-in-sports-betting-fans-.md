#  Anadolu Efes bets on new taxes to lure in sports betting fans 

Efes, one of the most successful teams in the Turkish Basketball League (TBL), is hoping that new taxes on sports betting will lure in more fans to its games. Turkey’s government recently announced plans to increase the taxes on sports betting, a move that is expected to bring in an additional 1.5 billion lira ($265 million) in revenue per year.

“We are very happy with this decision, which will increase the attractiveness of our product and lead to more spectators at our games,” said Efes CEO Suat Kılıç.

Kılıç went on to say that he expects the new taxes to have a positive impact on ticket sales and sponsorship revenue for his team. In addition, he believes that the increased taxes will help reduce illegal gambling in Turkey.

Efes is one of several teams in the TBL that stands to benefit from the new taxes. The league has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years, thanks in part to the emergence of superstar players like İbrahim Tabak and Ersan Ilyasova.

#  Turkey's Anadolu Efes ups taxes on sports betting in bid to boost revenues 

Turkey’s Anadolu Efes has reportedly increased taxes on sports betting in a bid to boost its revenues. According to a report from Reuters, the company raised taxes by up to 500 percent as of July 1st, which is expected to result in an increase in its overall revenue.

The move by Anadolu Efes comes as the Turkish government looks to shore up its finances amid a slowdown in the economy. The country’s finance ministry announced earlier this year that it was targeting an increase in tax revenues from the gaming sector of TRY500 million ($108 million) for 2019.

Anadolu Efes isn’t the only operator to have increased its taxes on sports betting recently. Earlier this month, rival Turk Telekom also increased its taxes by up to 500 percent, with both companies citing the government’s new target as the reason for the increase.

While operators are unhappy about the new tax hikes, there is little they can do about them. Under Turkish law, all gambling operations must be licensed by the country’s regulators, and it’s likely that any operator that doesn’t comply will be shut down.

#  Anadolu Efes triples taxes on sports betting in attempt to balance budget

The government of Anadolu Efes announced a tripling of taxes on sports betting in an attempt to address the city's budget deficit.

"The government has made a difficult but necessary decision in order to maintain the stability of our city and its finances," said a spokesperson for the city government.

The new tax rate will be 3% of the amount wagered, up from the previous rate of 1%. The increase is expected to bring in an additional 12 million euros per year.
