#  Colorado Tribes Vow to Fight for Their Right to Run Gambling Sites

Colorado tribes say they will continue to pursue their right to operate gambling sites, despite a recent decision by the U.S. Department of Justice that could limit their ability to do so.

Tribes have been pushing for years to gain the right to offer gambling on tribal lands, arguing that it is a vital source of revenue for them. But the DOJ’s recent ruling could stop them from doing so, as it says that the Wire Act applies only to sports betting.

Tribes are vowing to fight the ruling, with some saying they may take the issue to court. They argue that the Wire Act does not explicitly mention gambling and should not be applied in such a way as to prevent tribes from operating casinos.

“The Department of Justice doesn’t get to retroactively impose its current interpretation of an old law on us, especially when our rights and interests have been well-established for years,” said Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper in a statement.

While the DOJ’s ruling could potentially impact tribes in other states as well, Colorado is home to 11 tribes that operate casinos. These casinos generate more than $470 million in revenue annually and support more than 12,000 jobs.

#  Tribes Eye Online Gambling as a New Revenue Source

Since the dawn of internet gambling, tribes across the United States have eyed it as a potential new source of revenue. And while online gambling is currently legal only in three states, that number is expected to grow in 2020 when a new federal law goes into effect.

The 2012 reauthorization of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) included a provision that allows for online gambling on tribal lands. The provision, known as the “key provision” or “tribal authorization” clause, was designed to help tribes combat competition from offshore casinos.

So far, just three states – New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware – have taken advantage of the key provision, but that number is expected to grow in 2020 when a new federal law goes into effect. The new law, known as the “National Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Technical Correction Act of 2019” (H.R. 1174), amends the definition of class II gaming to include internet gaming and allows for interstate compacts between tribes for online poker and other games.

The technical correction act was introduced by Congressman Tom O’Halleran (D-AZ) in March 2019 and has since been endorsed by over two dozen tribes in Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. The act was also endorsed by the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA), which called it a “positive step forward for Indian Country”.

While there is still some concern about how the new law will be implemented, most experts believe it will benefit tribal casinos by allowing them to offer a wider range of games and compete more effectively against offshore casinos. And with millions of Americans already gambling online, there is potential for significant revenue growth.

According to a report by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, online gambling could generate $8 billion in revenue by 2022 – more than triple what it generated in 2017. Much of this growth is expected to come from states with large tribal populations, such as California and Arizona.

So far, only a few tribes have taken advantage of the key provision included in IGRA, but that is likely to change in 2020 when a new federal law goes into effect. The new law allows for interstate compacts between tribes for online poker and other games and could result in significant revenue growth for tribal casinos across the United States

#  Colorado Tribes Poised to Launch Statewide Online Gambling Operation

Colorado’s Native American tribes are planning to launch a statewide online gambling operation in the coming months, tribal leaders announced this week. The new gaming venture is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the tribes, which have long lobbied for expanded gambling rights in the state.

Details of the upcoming online gambling operation remain sketchy, but it is believed that the tribes will offer a variety of casino games, including slots, blackjack and poker. Players will be able to access the games via their computers or mobile devices.

Tribal leaders believe that the online gambling venture will not only be lucrative, but also help to promote tribal culture and traditions. “This is a great opportunity for our tribes to showcase our heritage and traditions,” said Chief Richard Sheck from the Southern Ute Tribe. “And we believe it will also create jobs and economic development opportunities for our people.”

Not everyone is thrilled with the impending launch of Colorado’s online gambling operation, however. Some lawmakers and casino operators have expressed concerns that the venture could cannibalize revenues from traditional brick-and-mortar casinos in the state.

Despite these concerns, tribal leaders remain optimistic about their new initiative. They point to similar ventures launched by other states – including New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania – as evidence that online gambling can be successful and profitable.

#  Tribes Defend $100M Annual Casino Revenue as Legitimate Gambling Operation

Indian tribes are defending their right to operate a $100 million annual casino as a legitimate gambling enterprise, despite opposition from state and local officials.

The casino, which is located on tribal land in the state of Washington, has been the subject of a long-running dispute between the tribe and state and local officials who argue that the casino should not be allowed because it is too close to urban areas.

But the tribe insists that the casino is a vital part of its economy and defends its right to operate it as a lawful gambling enterprise. The tribe also argues that the casino is important for creating jobs and generating revenue for the local community.

The casino has been in operation for more than 20 years and has been profitable every year, making it an important source of revenue for the tribe. In fact, the casino generates more than $100 million in revenue each year, making it one of the largest casinos in the region.

The tribe has also made significant investments in the casino, including installing new gaming machines and upgrading the facilities. The tribe says that it has no intention of closing down the casino and will continue to fight for its right to operate as a lawful gambling enterprise.

#  Colorado Tribes Ready to Rumble over Online Gambling Rights

Colorado tribes are preparing for a lengthy legal battle over the right to offer online gambling.

The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, whose reservation is located in southwest Michigan, is the first tribe in the state to introduce online gambling. But other tribes want in on the action.

Officials from the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and the Southern Ute Tribe say they should also be allowed to offer online gambling because their reservations are also located in Colorado.

The Pueblo of Tesuque, whose reservation is located near Santa Fe, New Mexico, says it should be able to offer online gambling because its members live in Colorado.

“The Pueblo has been playing bingo and poker and blackjack since the ’70s on its land in Tesuque, New Mexico,” said Pueblo of Tesuque Gov. Joseph Talachy. “We just want to do it on our computer screens now.”

Industry experts say that if all of these tribes are successful in their legal battle, it could open up the floodgates for online gambling nationwide.

“This is really just the beginning of the legal argument over this issue,” said gaming analyst Chris Grove. “But if all these tribes are successful, then it could pave the way for other tribes – and even states – to offer online gambling as well.”
