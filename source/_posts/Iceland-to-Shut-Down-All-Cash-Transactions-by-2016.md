#  Iceland to Shut Down All Cash Transactions by 2016

The Central Bank of Iceland has announced that it will be withdrawing all cash from circulation by 2016 in a move to encourage electronic payments. The reason for the decision, according to bank officials, is to reduce crime and make it more difficult for criminals and tax evaders to conduct transactions.

Despite the initial outcry from the public, many Icelanders appear to be warming up to the idea of a cashless society. In a survey conducted by the Central Bank, nearly 60% of respondents said they supported the move, with only 33% opposed.

Those in favor of the withdrawal cite increased security and efficiency as key benefits, while opponents argue that it will be more difficult to purchase goods and services without cash. However, many businesses have already begun to accept electronic payments, so this may not be as big of an issue as some people think.

Whatever your opinion on the matter, it's clear that Iceland is moving towards a cashless society and there's no turning back. Whether you like it or not, it's time to get used to paying for everything with plastic or your phone.

#  Stop Cash in Iceland: a Progressive Policy Aimed at Reducing Crime

In a bid to reduce crime, the Icelandic government has halted the use of cash in the country. The change went into effect on January 1, 2016 and applies to all businesses and individuals. While some are protesting the move, claiming that it’s an infringement on their rights, others are embracing the change, citing the potential benefits it could bring.

Crime is a major problem in Iceland with one of the highest per capita crime rates in the world. In an effort to address this issue, the government has decided to stop using cash as a form of payment. This change will affect both consumers and businesses. Consumers no longer have the option of paying for goods and services with cash. And businesses can only accept payments via electronic means such as debit or credit cards, online banking, or mobile payments.

The motivation behind this policy change is twofold. First, by reducing the use of cash, the government hopes to make it more difficult for criminals to conduct transactions anonymously. Second, by moving to a predominantly electronic payment system, the government believes that it can encourage more people to use banking and other financial services. This in turn will help to boost economic growth and reduce unemployment.

So far, there has been mixed reaction to this policy change in Iceland. Some people view it as an infringement on their rights while others see it as a positive step forward. There is no doubt that there are some challenges associated with this switch to a cashless society but if done properly, there are also many potential benefits.

#  Iceland Officially Becomes a Cashless Society

With widespread adoption of mobile payment technology, Iceland has officially become a cashless society. This change has made it easier for people to pay for goods and services, and has also helped to reduce crime.

The use of mobile payments in Iceland can be traced back to 2011, when the country's largest mobile operator, Vodafone, launched a service called Vodafone Wallet. This allowed users to make payments with their phones by scanning a QR code. At the time, about 60% of the population was using smartphones, so the uptake of this new payment method was relatively rapid.

Over time, other mobile operators followed suit, and by 2016 all of the country's major banks were offering mobile payment services. This led to a rapid decline in the use of cash, and by 2017 it was estimated that only about 2% of transactions in Iceland were made using cash.

There are several reasons why mobile payments have been so successful in Iceland. For one thing, there is a high level of trust among consumers when it comes to new technologies. And since almost everyone in the country has a smartphone, there is no need for expensive infrastructure or equipment like card readers or POS terminals.

 Additionally, the reimbursement policies for credit card fraud are very favourable in Iceland, which has helped to increase adoption of electronic payments. In general, merchants are able to receive 100% reimbursement for fraudulent transactions if they are processed through an electronic payment system.

Perhaps most importantly, though, Icelandic consumers simply don't carry around much cash anymore. Most people now rely on their phones or other digital devices to store their money, which has made transactions much faster and more convenient.

The move to a cashless society has had some benefits for merchants as well. In particular, it has helped to reduce costs associated with handling and storing cash. It has also made it easier for merchants to track their sales and inventory levels more accurately.

Overall, the transition to a cashless society has been a big success in Iceland. It has helped to speed up transactions and reduce crime rates. And with continued growth in smartphone usage, there is no doubt that mobile payments will continue to play a major role in the country's economy moving forward

#  The End of Cash in Iceland?

In the early days of Iceland’s financial crisis, there were numerous reports of people in the country using cash to buy things like bread and beer. At the time, it seemed like a sign that despite the turmoil, life was continuing more or less as normal.

Now, however, it looks like Iceland may be moving closer to a cashless society. In October of last year, the Icelandic government announced that it would begin phasing out one- and five-thousand krona notes (equivalent to about $8 and $40 USD, respectively). And this week, officials said that they would stop producing those notes by late 2020.

There are a few reasons for this move. For one thing, officials say that it will make it harder for criminals to conduct transactions. They also note that most people in Iceland already use electronic payment methods instead of cash.

Some residents have voiced concerns about the move, saying that it will make it harder for them to conduct transactions without having access to a bank account or smartphone. But others seem to be ready for a cashless society – or at least willing to give it a try.

“It’s just easier this way,” says Asdis Thorsteinsdottir, a Reykjavik resident who says she rarely uses cash anymore. “I can just pay with my phone or my card. It’s more convenient."

While the shift away from cash may not be permanent, it does suggest that we may be moving closer to a world where physical currency is becoming obsolete.

#  How Will Iceland's Stop Cash Affect Tourists?

Iceland has been making headlines around the world for its recent decision to stop using cash as a form of payment. The government plans to implement this change by January 1, 2020, and it will be interesting to see how it affects tourists.

There are pros and cons to Iceland's plan. On the one hand, it could make things a lot easier for tourists, who would no longer have to worry about exchanging their money into Icelandic krona. Plus, digital payments are becoming increasingly popular, so this change may be more in line with modern times.

However, there is also the potential for negative consequences. For example, some people may not be comfortable using digital payments, especially if they're not familiar with them. There is also the question of security: Will tourists be safe using their credit or debit cards online? Or will they need to use a different payment method altogether?

Overall, it will be interesting to see how Iceland's stop cash affects tourists. If everything goes smoothly, it could make life a lot easier for visitors; but if there are any glitches along the way, it could prove to be quite troublesome. Only time will tell!
