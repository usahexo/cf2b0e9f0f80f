#  Place your bets: which country will win the World Cup?

The World Cup is a little more than a month away, and the excitement is mounting. 32 teams from around the world will compete for the title of World Champion, and there are plenty of contenders.

Brazil is the favorite, as always. The South American powerhouse has won 5 World Cups, more than any other country. They're led by Neymar, one of the best players in the world, and they're stocked with world-class talent up and down the roster.

Germany is another strong contender. They've won the World Cup 4 times, more than any other European country. They're led by attacking stars like Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil, and they looked unstoppable in qualifying.

Spain is always a threat, and they'll be looking to rebound from their disappointing performance in Brazil 2014. Argentina is always dangerous with Lionel Messi leading the attack, and France has emerged as a dark horse contender with their young stars Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe.

There are plenty of other teams that could win it all as well. England has never won a World Cup, but they have a talented young squad led by captain Harry Kane. Belgium is one of the most balanced teams in the tournament, and Portugal has Cristiano Ronaldo leading the charge.



So who will win it all? Place your bets now and see if you can come out on top!
