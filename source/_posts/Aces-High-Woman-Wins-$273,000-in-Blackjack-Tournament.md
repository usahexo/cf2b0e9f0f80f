#  Aces High: Woman Wins $273,000 in Blackjack Tournament

A woman playing in a blackjack tournament at the Aces High casino in Las Vegas has walked away with a $273,000 payday.

The woman, who has not been named, was one of 116 entrants in the no-limit Texas hold’em tournament, each paying $1,500 to enter. The winner was determined by who had the best hand after three rounds of play.

After two rounds of play, the woman was tied for first place with four other players. In the third and final round,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/), she managed to win three out of five hands against her competitors to take home the top prize.

This is not the first big win for the woman; she also took first place in a blackjack tournament at another Las Vegas casino earlier this year, winning $100,000. She says that she plans to use her latest winnings to buy a new house.

#  Amateur Gambler Hits the Jackpot with Two Aces

Who says that amateurs can't win big? Wade Harder, an amateur gambler from Tulsa, Oklahoma, proved this week that under the right circumstances anyone can hit the jackpot.

Harder was playing blackjack at a casino in Las Vegas when he was dealt two aces. With such a strong hand, he decided to bet big and went all in. His opponents folded, and Harder walked away with a cool $100,000.

"This is the biggest win I've ever had," said Harder. "I can't believe it actually worked out."

While luck played a role in Harder's victory, skill also played a part. By betting big when he had a strong hand, he forced his opponents to fold and took the pot uncontested.

This isn't the first time an amateur gambler has struck it rich. In 2010, an Oregon man won more than $2 million playing blackjack at a casino in Reno.

So if you're feeling lucky, give gambling a try. You might be surprised at what you can achieve.

#  Online Casino Dealer Fools All with Two Aces

Edward Gardner, an online casino dealer at Manchester-based Grosvenor Casino, managed to fool all of the players at his table on Thursday night with a simple trick. He played two aces as though they were two different cards and won the hand.

Gardner played the first ace as the two of clubs and the second ace as the four of spades. When he turned over the fifth card - which was also an ace - all of the other players at the table assumed he had been duped by another player and lost their bets. In fact, Gardner had managed to win the hand with his two aces.

"It's just one of those things that sometimes happens in casino poker," said Gardner after his lucky win. "I'm just glad that I was able to take advantage of it and walk away with some extra money."

This isn't the first time that an online casino dealer has managed to fool all of the other players at their table. In November 2015, an online dealer at Paddy Power Casino successfully pulled off a similar trick, winning £6,000 in the process.

#  Lucky Lady Banks $273,000 on Two Aces

A Northern California woman visiting Philadelphia hit it big over the weekend, banking $273,000 on two aces at a casino.

The lucky lady, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing blackjack at the SugarHouse Casino when she was dealt two aces. She opted to split them and doubled down on each hand for a total bet of $4,000. Her gamble paid off handsomely as she won twice, taking home $136,000 on the first hand and $137,000 on the second.

While this may seem like an amazing stroke of luck, smart play at blackjack can often lead to big wins. Splitting aces is always a good move if there are other high value cards on the table, as it increases the chances of drawing another ace or face card and thereby doubles your bet. Doubling down is also a risky but potentially rewarding move that can result in a bigger payout if you win.

So if you're feeling lucky next time you hit the casino, don't be afraid to try out some of these more daring plays. You never know - you might just walk away with a huge windfall!
