   It's inevitable that at some point, you'll need to factory reset your Android device. Maybe you're selling it, or giving it to someone else; or maybe it's just not working right and a factory reset is your last hope. Whatever the reason may be, here are seven easy steps to follow to get the job done quickly and easily.    Step 1:Back up your device  The first thing you'll want to do before performing a factory reset is back up your device. This will ensure that none of your data is lost in the process. There are a number of ways you can do this, but we recommend using Google's cloud-based backup service, which is free and easy to use. To set it up, go to Settings > Backup & reset >Backup account and follow the onscreen instructions. If you don't have a Google account, or don't want to use Google's backup service, there are a number of other options available, such as iCloud, Dropbox, and Titanium Backup.    Step 2:Factory reset your Android device Once you've backed up your data, it's time to perform the factory reset. This will restore your device to its original state, just like when it came out of the box. To do this, go to Settings > Backup & reset > Factory data reset and follow the onscreen instructions. If you have a lock screen password or pattern, you'll be asked to enter it before continuing.    Step 3:Restore your backed up data After performing the factory reset, it's time to restore the data that you backed up earlier. To do this, simply connect your device to your computer and drag and drop the files into the appropriate folders (or use any of the other methods described in our article on how to transfer files between Android and PC). Note that if you have an iTunes library, you can also restore all of your music, movies, TV shows, etc., by connecting your Android phone or tablet to iTunes and selecting "Sync."    Step 4:Reconfigure your device settings Now that all of your data is back in place, it's time for a little housekeeping. Reconfigure any settings that were changed during the backup process (e.g., restoring contacts automatically from Gmail), then install any necessary updates for apps and Android OS itself (these should be automatically installed after step 2). You may also want to sign into any services that you had signed out of (such as Facebook) before refreshing your Android device. Lastly, if you're selling or giving away your old device, be sure to remove all personal information from it (see our article on How To Wipe Your Android Phone Before Selling It).    Step 5:Reinstall apps Now that all of the necessary preparations have been made, it's time to reinstall all of those apps that were removed during the backup process (you did back them up didn't you?). If you're not sure where they all went or which ones need reinstalling, check out our comprehensive guide on how to transfer app data from one Android phone or tablet to another . Alternatively, if you just want a quick list of which apps need installing , we've got that too! Finally – unless there are specific app requirements – don't bother installing the OEM firmware because many preferring using custom ROMs anyway most times rom updating becomes senseless with pre-installed bloatware given by carriers/manufacturers #USA UK only bloatware uk oem firmware preinstalled no good reasons now days so skip em!

#  How to delete everything on your Android device and start over

If you're feeling frustrated with your Android device, and want to start fresh, deleting everything and starting over is a viable option. This process will delete all of your data and apps, so make sure you have a backup before you begin.

1. Back up your data

Before deleting anything on your Android device, make sure you have a backup of all your important data. This includes photos, videos, music, contacts, and any other files that are important to you.

There are several ways to back up your data. If you have a Google account, you can use the free Google Drive app to back up your files. You can also use a third-party app like Dropbox or iCloud to back up your files.

2. Factory reset your device

Once you've backed up your data, it's time to factory reset your device. This will delete all of your data and apps, and restore the phone to its original state.

To factory reset your device, open the Settings app and scroll down to the bottom. Tap on "Backup & Reset" and tap on "Factory Data Reset". Tap on "Reset Device" and then tap on "Delete All".

Your device will now be reset to its original state. Be sure to reinstall any necessary apps and restore any backed-up data before using the device again.
