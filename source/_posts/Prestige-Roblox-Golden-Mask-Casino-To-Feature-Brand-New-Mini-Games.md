#  Cables United States Casinos Could Be Shut Down In The Near Future

States are increasingly looking to block online gambling, and that could spell trouble for US casinos.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that casino companies such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment could see their operations in the US come to a grinding halt in the near future. That’s because more states are moving to prohibit online gambling, which is seen as a major threat to the industry.

At the moment, there are 10 states that allow some form of online gambling. But this could soon change, with lawmakers in several states – including New York, Illinois and Michigan – pushing for bans on the activity.

This isn’t good news for casino operators, many of whom have seen their profits dwindle in recent years. In 2017, American casino revenue fell by 5%, according to industry research firm GPI. Much of this can be attributed to the growth of online gambling, which has eaten into the profits of casinos operating in traditional formats.

It remains to be seen whether lawmakers will be successful in their efforts to ban online gambling. But if they are, it could have a devastating impact on the US casino industry.

#  Make Sure Your Cables Are United Before Visiting Any US Casino

As one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, the United States is home to dozens of casino resorts. From the massive Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to the intimate Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, these properties offer something for everyone.

No matter which casino you choose to visit, though, one thing is always important: make sure your cables are united. By that, we mean make sure all your cables - phone, power, and data - are plugged into the same outlet before entering the property.

If you're not careful, you could find yourself without power or data access when you need it most. And in this age of smartphones and mobile gaming, that's a mistake you can't afford to make.

So before hitting the road for your next casino vacation, be sure to check out our guide to cable management and make sure everything is plugged in properly. And remember: united we stand, divided we fall!
