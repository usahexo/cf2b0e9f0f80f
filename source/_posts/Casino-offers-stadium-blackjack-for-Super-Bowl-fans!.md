#  Casino offers stadium blackjack for Super Bowl fans!

In honor of the Super Bowl, a casino in Las Vegas is offering stadium blackjack. This is a new game that allows players to bet on blackjack as they would in a live casino. The game is being offered at the Mirage hotel and casino.

The game is simple to play. You make your bet, and then you are dealt two cards. After that, you can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with your current total). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If you go over 21, you “bust” and lose your bet.

Casino officials say that the stadium blackjack tables will be open all weekend, leading up to the Super Bowl on Sunday. They also say that the game will be available at other casinos in the city, including MGM Grand and Wynn Las Vegas.

Whether you are a football fan or not, it might be worth checking out stadium blackjack this weekend. It is a fun and exciting game that can add an extra level of excitement to your Super Bowl experience!

#  Casino offers stadium blackjack for college football fans!

Recently, a casino in Pennsylvania announced it will offer stadium blackjack for college football fans this fall. The new game, which is being offered at the Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, will allow fans to bet on games while they’re taking place.

The casino says that the game will be available on Saturdays during the college football season, and that fans can place bets at one of several betting kiosks that will be set up in the stadium. In addition, there will also be a designated area for fans who want to watch the games while they’re betting.

According to the casino’s executive director of gaming operations, Brian Schuster, the new game is designed to give fans a more interactive experience when they’re watching their favorite teams play.

“This is an exciting opportunity for us to bring an immersive and engaging gaming experience to our guests who are passionate about college football,” said Schuster in a statement. “We are looking forward to offering this unique new amenity and hope that it enhances the excitement and enjoyment of watching their favorite teams compete.”

It remains to be seen how popular stadium blackjack will be among college football fans, but it looks like it could certainly be a hit! If you’re interested in giving it a try, make sure you head over to the Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course this fall!

#  Casino celebrates major league baseball with stadium blackjack!

This year, Major League Baseball is celebrating its 150th anniversary. In honor of this milestone, many of the casinos around the country are offering special promotions to baseball fans. One casino in Vegas is going all out with a replica of a major league stadium inside their casino!

The stadium blackjack game at the Casino celebrates all things baseball. From the replica field and bases, to the giant Jumbotron scoreboard in the middle of the room, everything is decked out in sports paraphernalia. Even the dealers are dressed up in baseball uniforms!

The object of stadium blackjack is to score more points than your opponents. You can achieve points by either hitting or standing on your hand, or by drawing extra cards (just like in regular blackjack). The first player to achieve 21 (or come as close as possible) wins the hand and 1 point for their team. If both players have 21, then it’s a draw and no points are awarded.

In addition to standard blackjack rules, here are a few other things to keep in mind when playing stadium blackjack:

- There are 2 teams playing, called The Yankees and The Mets. Pick a team before you start playing.
- The casino supplies each player with 5 chips worth $10 each. This represents your team’s budget for the hand. Once you lose all 5 chips, your hand is over and you’re out of the game.
- You can only bet on one team per hand. So if you have 4 chips left, you can bet 2 on Team Yankee and 2 on Team Mets. Or you could bet 1 chip on each team - it’s up to you!
- The dealer always stands on 17.
- Suits don’t matter (except for when determining whether or not you have a Blackjack).

Now that you know how to play, let's take a look at some strategy tips for stadium blackjack:

1) When deciding whether to hit or stand, always remember that the point values of cards are different in this game than in regular blackjack. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and kings, queens and jacks are all worth 10 points each. So if you have an ace and a 2 (a total of 3), you should hit because your odds of getting another card that will make 21 are pretty good.




2) Another thing to keep in mind is that there is an extra card deck in play - this means that there is a higher chance of getting certain cards than in regular blackjack games. For example, there are 16 cards remaining in the deck that will make your next card an Ace - so if you need an Ace for your hand, be patient and wait for it!




3) It might be tempting to go all out and bet big bucks on one hand - but remember that doing so could quickly deplete your team’s funds. Try spreading your bets around instead, and see if you can win more than one hand in a row!

#  Casino offers special stadium blackjack game during March Madness!

March Madness is one of the most popular events in the United States, and as such, many casinos are getting in on the action by offering special blackjack games. 

Casino properties in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and other gambling destinations are now hosting blackjack games where players can wager on teams playing in the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship. The games work like this: players make a bet on which team will win their matchup, and then receive a bonus payout if their team wins the game. For instance, if you bet $10 on Michigan to beat Louisville and they pull off the upset, you would win an additional $50 payout (assuming no other bets were placed on that game). 

The bonuses for these games vary from casino to casino, but typically range from 2X to 5X your original bet. So if you’re feeling lucky and want to try your hand at some March Madness betting, be sure to check out your local casino’s special blackjack game offerings!
