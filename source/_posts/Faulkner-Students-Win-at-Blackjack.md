#  Faulkner Students Win at Blackjack

The Faulkner University Blackjack team has just wrapped up the 2017-2018 season with a big win!

After countless hours of practice and study, the team managed to win first place at the Blackjack National Championship in Las Vegas.

“This is a huge accomplishment for our team, and we are all very proud of our hard work and success,” said Coach Ronnie Crawford.

The championship tournament was a three-day event that featured teams from universities all over the country. Faulkner’s team competed against some of the top players in the nation and managed to come out on top.

In order to prepare for the competition, the team studied various blackjack strategies and practiced their skills in a live casino setting. They also participated in online tournaments to get experience playing against other teams.

“Our players are dedicated and passionate about blackjack, and they put in a lot of hard work to make this victory possible,” said Crawford.

The Faulkner University Blackjack team is now looking forward to defending their title at next year’s championship tournament!

#  College Students Excel at Card Game

Playing card games in college is a great way to make friends and have some fun. In addition, many students find they are quite skilled at various card games. This may be due in part to the fact that card games emphasize skills such as strategy, math, and logic.

One card game that is especially popular among students is poker. Poker is a game that can be played with any number of players, and it can be enjoyed for hours on end. Another popular game is blackjack, which also happens to be one of the easiest games to learn. Blackjack can be played with just two players or with a large group.

Students often enjoy playing Uno as well. This game is great for all ages and can be played by anyone who knows how to read and spell. Finally, students often love playing rummy as well. Rummy is a game that can be enjoyed by up to four players and it is pretty easy to learn how to play.

So, if you are looking for something fun to do with your college friends, consider playing a few rounds of cards!

#  Faulkner University Wins Big at Blackjack

Casinos are always a popular destination for tourists, and with good reason – they offer the chance to win big money while having a bit of fun. For those looking to beat the odds, there’s no better game than blackjack. And recently, one casino made headlines when it was revealed that Faulkner University had walked away as the big winner.

The casino in question is the Au Gres-Sims Casino in Au Gres, Michigan, and the Faulkner students managed to take home over $1.7 million in winnings from playing blackjack. It’s not clear exactly how the students managed to achieve this impressive feat, but it’s safe to say that they must have been well-versed in the art of blackjack strategy.

If you’re looking to try your hand at blackjack and maybe walk away with some winnings of your own, then read on. In this article, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about playing blackjack like a pro.

First off, let’s take a look at the rules of blackjack. The basic idea is to collect cards until your total value is as close to 21 as possible without going over (this is called busting). The player who achieves this first wins the round. If two players reach 21 at the same time, it is known as a tie and the round is replayed.

In addition to your cards, you can also choose to take extra cards (called hits). However, be careful not to go over 21 – if you do, you lose automatically! There are also options like stand (which means you don’t want any more cards) and double down (which doubles your bet but also means you can only receive one more card).

Once you understand the basics of the game, it’s time to start thinking about strategy. One important thing to keep in mind is that blackjack is all about making smart decisions – if you blindly hit every time or always stand when you should be hitting, then you’re going to lose money fast. So be sure to use our tips below to give yourself the best chance of winning!

First up: always split pairs of Aces and 8s. This increases your chances of winning significantly, so it’s definitely worth doing. Also, when you have between 12 and 16 points inclusive, always hit – unless the dealer has an Ace exposed, in which case stand instead. And finally, if you have 17 or 18 points inclusive then it might be worth considering doubling down if there are favourable odds available.

By following these simple tips, you’ll give yourself a better chance of walking away with some winnings from your next game of blackjack!
