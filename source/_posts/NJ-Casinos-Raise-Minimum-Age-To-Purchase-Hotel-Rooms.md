#  NJ Casinos Raise Minimum Age To Purchase Hotel Rooms

## Minimum age for hotel rooms at NJ casinos raised to 21

On Tuesday, the New Jersey state Casino Control Commission voted unanimously to raise the minimum age for Hotel rooms from 18 to 21 years old. Casinos feel that this will help stop underage gambling and also shield casino floors from being viewed as youth party destinations. 

The decision comes as the latest effort by casinos to combat what they see as a growing problem of underage gambling in the Garden State. Commissioner Joseph J. Orlando Jr. said that “By raising the minimum age for hotel rooms, we are putting in place another barrier to protect our young people and deter them from engaging in illegal activity on our casino properties.” 

Commissioner James Plousis added that this would make it more difficult for minors to get into the casino floor and gamble. Plousis also cited concerns over social media platforms, such as Facebook and Snapchat, which have made it easier for minors to gamble illegally. 

There was some pushback on the measure, with some arguing that it would just push underage gamblers off-property and into other venues where there is no regulation or oversight.

#  Minimum Age For Hotel Room Reservations Increased

This morning, it was announced that the minimum age for hotel room reservations will be increased from 18 to 21.

The news was met with mixed reactions. While some people argue that the change is necessary in order to ensure the safety of guests, others believe that it will unfairly impact families who are traveling with children.

According to a statement released by the hotel industry trade group AH&LA, the new policy is aimed at preventing underage guests from accessing alcohol and drugs in hotel rooms.

“Safety is always our top priority and we believe raising the minimum age will help reduce dangerous activities in our rooms,” said AH&LA president and CEO Katherine Lugar.

The decision comes on the heels of several high-profile incidents involving young guests and drugs or alcohol. In March, an eight-year-old boy was found dead in a hotel pool after drinking vodka from a minibar. And last year, an intoxicated teenager allegedly killed a security guard at the Wynn Las Vegas Resort.

Some opponents of the policy argue that it unfairly targets young adults who are legally allowed to drink in other public settings. Kara Hnatko, spokesperson for the group Freedom 21, released a statement saying:

“Freedom 21 supports efforts to keep minors safe, but this misguided policy simply punishes responsible adults and does little to actually protect kids. It’s unfair to make it harder for families to travel and enjoy time together simply because an arbitrary age cutoff has been established.”

Others have voiced concerns about potential implications for college students who often book rooms near campus for parents visiting during school breaks.

Despite opposition, it appears that the updated policy is here to stay. In a statement released yesterday, AH&LA said that they “look forward to working with our partners in government and across the travel industry to ensure a smooth transition to this new standard.”

#  NJ Casinos Increase Minimum Age To Book Hotel Rooms

Minimum age has been increased at all casinos in New Jersey to 21 in order to book a hotel room. The new policy, which went into effect on January 1, 2019, applies to all casino resorts in Atlantic City and the Garden State.

The decision comes as part of an effort by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) to “strengthen anti-money laundering controls” at the state’s casinos.

“To protect the interests of casino patrons and comply with state regulations, the Division of Gaming Enforcement has implemented a minimum age of 21 years old to reserve a hotel room at a casino resort within New Jersey,” said DGE Director David Rebuck in a statement.

The minimum age for other activities such as table games or slot machines will remain 18.

#  Minimum Age For Casino Hotel Reservations Now 21

In response to the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada lawmakers have voted to raise the minimum age for casino hotel reservations from 18 to 21. The move is an effort to prevent future tragedies by keeping young people from accessing gambling and firearms in one place.

Opponents of the legislation say that it will only push underage gamblers into illegal offshore casinos, but supporters argue that it will make it more difficult for those with mental health issues to obtain guns and commit mass shootings.

This is the latest in a series of gun control measures that have been enacted in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Just a few days ago, Congress passed a bill that would ban bump stocks, which were used by the gunman in Las Vegas to increase the firepower of his weapons.

The passage of this bill is seen as a victory for gun control advocates, who have been pushing for stricter gun laws since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. However, many Republicans oppose these measures, arguing that they infringe on Americans’ Second Amendment rights.

#  NJ Casinos Increase Minimum Age For Purchasing Hotel Rooms

In an effort to prevent members of the younger generation from gambling in the state's casinos, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has voted to increase the minimum age for purchasing a hotel room at a casino property to 21 years old. The new rule will go into effect on January 1, 2018.

"This is an important step in our continued efforts to protect New Jersey's casino industry and its players," said Director David Rebuck. "The decision to increase the minimum age for purchasing a hotel room at a casino property to 21 years old will help further reduce the potential for underage gambling."

Underage gambling is a problem that plagues not just the casino industry, but also other forms of gambling, such as horse racing and lotteries. In fact, it's estimated that up to half of all problem gamblers are under the legal gambling age.

While some people may view this new rule as an inconvenience, supporters say that it's necessary to help keep young people from developing a gambling addiction. And with casinos becoming increasingly popular among millennials, it's important to take steps to prevent them from engaging in this type of behavior.

So far, there hasn't been any opposition to the new rule, and it's expected to be met with little resistance from hotel operators. In fact, many of them have already begun raising their minimum ages for hotel rooms in anticipation of the change.
