#  Martin Scorsese to Direct Casino

In a surprise move, Martin Scorsese has announced that he will be directing the next Casino movie. The film, which is already in pre-production, will star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.

This will be the third time that Scorsese and De Niro have worked together, after Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. It will also be the fourth time that Scorsese and Pesci have teamed up, after Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino.

Casino was released in 1995 and was based on a true story. It starred De Niro, Pesci, Sharon Stone, and James Woods. It was a massive hit at the box office and won two Academy Awards.

In August of last year, it was announced that Pesci was officially retiring from acting. This means that this will be his final role on the big screen.

No further details about the film have been released as of yet.

#  Sam Mendes to Direct Casino

Sam Mendes will be directing the next James Bond movie, Casino. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming.

The plot for the movie is still under wraps, but it is known that Mendes will be using some of the plot points from the original book. The movie is set to start filming in early 2020 and is set to be released in November of that year.

Casino will be Mendes' second James Bond movie. He previously directed Skyfall which was released in 2012 and went on to become the highest-grossing Bond movie ever made.

Mendes is no stranger to success when it comes to movies. He has won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and two BAFTA Awards. His work on Skyfall earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Director.

Daniel Craig will once again be playing James Bond and is looking forward to working with Mendes again. "His films are emotional, stirring and he gets the best out of his actors," Craig said about Mendes in an interview with Empire magazine. "I always enjoy working with him."

#  Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes to Co-Direct Casino

Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes are set to co-direct the upcoming Warner Bros. film Casino. The two Oscar-winning filmmakers will reunite after teaming up on the stage production of “Cabaret” in 2014.

The movie is based on the 1995 book by Nicholas Pileggi, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie version of “Goodfellas”, which was directed by Scorsese. Pileggi’s book tells the true story of mobster Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran and his involvement in the casino industry in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

No casting decisions have been announced yet, but it is expected that Leonardo DiCaprio will star in the lead role. DiCaprio previously worked with Scorsese on “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Gangs of New York”, and has expressed his interest in playing Sheeran in the past.

Mendes is no stranger to directing movies based on true stories either, having won an Oscar for his work on “American Beauty”. He last directed the James Bond film “Skyfall” in 2012.

Casino is expected to begin production in early 2019.

#  Steven Spielberg to Direct Casino

Casino will be directed by Steven Spielberg and is set to release in theaters on November 22, 2019.

The film is based on the book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie.

Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are set to reprise their roles as Sam “Ace” Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, respectively. The rest of the cast has not yet been announced.

This will be the first time that De Niro and Pesci have starred in a movie together since 1995’s Casino.

#  Quentin Tarantino to Direct Casino

Casino, the movie about the rise and fall of mobsters in Las Vegas, is set to get a new lease on life, with Quentin Tarantino set to direct.

The project has been in development for years, but it looks like it’s finally going to happen, with The Hateful Eight filmmaker taking the reins.

Leonardo DiCaprio is said to be eyeing a role in the movie, possibly as casino kingpin Frank Rosenthal.

Martin Scorsese was originally attached to direct Casino, but he eventually left the project. Now it looks like Tarantino is going to take up the challenge and bring his unique vision to the movie.

This could be an interesting pairing, with Tarantino’s style matched against Scorsese’s more traditional approach. It should be interesting to see how they both shape the story of Casino.

Casino is based on a true story, and follows the rise and fall of mobsters like Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel. It promises to be a thrilling movie full of action and suspense.
