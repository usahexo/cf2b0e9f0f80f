#  Mayweather vs. McGregor Draws Huge Betting Action In Monaco

As the biggest fight in combat sports history rapidly approaches, so too does the WrestleMania-sized betting action.

Mayweather vs. McGregor is expected to break all previous betting records, as bettors from around the globe are flooding sportsbooks with money on the fight.

In Monaco, one of the world's most popular gambling destinations, the talk is all about the fight. And while both fighters are considered heavy favorites, it's the underdog - Conor McGregor - who is drawing all of the action.

"McGregor is absolutely destroying Mayweather in terms of bets," said a spokesperson for one of Monaco's largest sportsbooks. "We've never seen anything like this before."

In fact, 95% of all bets being placed on the fight are on McGregor to win. This has caused Mayweather's odds to drift from -800 (meaning you would have to wager $800 to win $100) to as high as -1,000 in some places. McGregor, meanwhile, is now down to +500 (meaning you would only have to wager $100 to win $500).

Why is McGregor such a big favorite? Bettors believe that he has a real chance of winning this fight. Yes, Mayweather is an incredibly talented boxer and has never lost a professional bout. But McGregor is no slouch either and comes into this fight with a record of 21-3 with 18 of those wins coming by way of knockout.

There's also the question of ring rust. Mayweather has been retired since September 2015 and many think that he may not be as sharp as he once was. McGregor, on the other hand, has been very active in MMA and is coming off of a victory over Eddie Alvarez last November.

As we get closer and closer to fight night, the betting action will only continue to grow. So if you're thinking about placing a bet on this fight, now is definitely the time to do it!

#  Mayweather Early 5/6 Favorite To Win Saturday's Bout; McGregor outcry in Monaco

The chasm between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor's fighting abilities is the widest it has ever been according to odds makers. VegasInsider.com, as of Tuesday, had Mayweather a -600 favorite with McGregor coming back at +400.

"This is by far the most lopsided betting matchup in recent history," said Chris Andrews, oddsmaker for VegasInsider.com. "We have seen several times where one fighter was a big favorite, but never to this extent."

As the days count down to their Saturday night bout in Las Vegas, fans of Irishman McGregor are hoping he can pull off what would likely be considered the biggest upset in sports history. Mayweather (49-0), who is coming out of retirement for this fight at the age of 40, is an incredibly skilled boxer and is currently listed as the No. 1 pound-for-pound boxer by ESPN. McGregor (21-3), on the other hand, is making his professional boxing debut and is more known as a UFC champion who has never boxed before in his life.

"McGregor may have some chance if he connects with something big early on, but I don't see him lasting 12 rounds against Mayweather," Andrews said.

Despite being such a heavy underdog, McGregor continues to bring in record bets from backers wishing to back him to win. According to multiple reports, most of these bets have come in from Ireland and the U.K., where folks seem to be more confident that their countryman can pull off the upset.

Mayweather has consistently made it clear he thinks this will be an easy fight for him and that McGregor doesn't stand a chance. In a recent interview with ESPN's Stephen A. Smith, Mayweather said: "I'm not gonna sit right here and blow smoke up your ass and tell you that Conor McGregor's gonna beat me because he's not."

The Mediterranean tax haven is home to some of the world's biggest gamblers and bookmakers, who are confident Mayweather will extend his perfect record to 50-0.

"In terms of betting, it is all one-way traffic," a spokesman for the principality's SBM casino group said. "Most of the money is going on Mayweather."

According to media reports, more than $120 million has already been wagered on the fight in Las Vegas alone, with most of the money backing Mayweather.

"There is so much at stake," said Matthew Glozier, research manager at Australian gambling firm Sportsbet. "This isn't just about two fighters putting their pride on the line, this is about two businesses clashing."

Mayweather is expected to earn around $200 million from the bout, while McGregor could take home $100 million, making it by far the richest fight in history.
